# React counter

You have the `App` with a title and 3 buttons. Implementted `addOne` and `add100` functions so the buttons work the next way:

- `Add 1` button calls `addOne` method to add `1` to the `count`;
- `Add 100` button calls `add100` method to add `100` to the `count`;
- `Increase` button calls `addOne` and then, if count was divisible by 5, it additionally calls `add100`.

So the third button should count like this:
`101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 311 ...`
